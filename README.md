The closest third person camera I could archieve to The OG Xbox version of Ghost Recon 2

Code is literally a single line, so If you want to edit it, you can unpack the .pbo and edit the line, I placed a commentary on how to tweak each value.

I also wanted to create a in-game menu for this, but need a lot more of work aside of requiring creating anew camera and messing with real time scripting which I don't want to mess with.

Using the vanilla camera will save you from further issues.
